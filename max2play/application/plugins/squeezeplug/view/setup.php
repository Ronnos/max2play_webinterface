	<br />
	<b>SqueezePlug</b> is now a plug-in in <b>Max2Play</b> to make the configuration as easy as possible. There is no need for connecting a monitor, a keyboard or a mouse on the device itself. It all runs headless and no special tools like Putty are needed. The configuration is as simple as configuring a router from an webinterface!");

	Type "http://max2play" in the address bar of your webbrowser. If the SqueezePlug & Max2Play site does not start up, try to connect via the IP-Address. For that you will need to know this address. Look it up in your router or use a tool like <a href="http://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com" target="_blank">Advanced IP Scanner</a>. If you are not able to connect either ways, connect a monitor and a keyboard to the Mini-Computer, log in and type "ifconfig".

Otherwise you will run out of space immediately. To expand the card choose the "SETTINGS / REBOOT" menu, go to the section "Reboot / Update / Filesystem Settings" and click on "Expand Filesystem".

	Choose the "WIFI / LAN" menu to configure your network settings. SqueezePlug & Max2Play uses the wired connection with DHCP by default. This means that you will get an IP-Address from your router while booting, if DHCP on the router is enabled. A LAN-Connection is always necessary on the first boot. If you like, you can configure a additional WLAN(WiFi)-Connection. If the WLAN-Connection is working, you can simply cut the LAN-Connection.

If the Media-Files are stored on the SD-Card you booted from, there is no need to do anything here. If it is stored on a USB-drive this will be mounted automatically to /media/usb and /media/usb0. If you attach more than one USB-drive, they will be mounted to /media/usb1 to /media/usb7. If your Media-Files are stored on an network location you have to configure it from this site. Everything you will need to do is explained here. If you like to enable the Mini-Computer to work as a Samba-Server, go to the section "Sambashares on Max2Play - setup network share paths". If configured correctly, you are now able to see your Mini-Computer as a network-share form the PCs in your home LAN. You can now easily transfer files to your Mini-Computer from other computers in your Home-LAN.')?>

	" and you will find all you need to get Squeezebox Server installed. Please remember, that it will take a while, till the Squeezebox Server webinterface is reachable after the installation. After the installation has finished, you can access the Squeezebox Server webinterface by choosing "Start Squeezebox Sserver Webadministration". One of the first things you have to configure here is the path to your media files. Please choose the path depending on the settings in the earlier steps.

	To configure you Mini-Computer as an AudioPlayer choose the menu "AUDIOPLAYER". From here you can configure three different players. For the Squeezebox Server environment you need the SqueezeLite player. To play from your Apple-Devices you need ShairPort. The gmediarender is a DLNA-Client for audio running with all DLNA compatible media-servers. All the players can run simultaneously. Please configure the appropriate soundcard for your system. To change the name of your player choose the menu "SETTINGS / REBOOT" and you will find an option to change it. Please remember, that you will not only change the player name, you will also change the hostname of your Mini-Computer. So the URL for your Mini-Computer will also change. ')?>
